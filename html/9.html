Due to the current world health crisis, many Filipino students are compelled to engage in Massive Open Online Course (MOOC) in order to continue with their studies, and the concept of ubiquitous learning (that is, learning anywhere, everywhere, anytime and every time) has been realized sooner than expected for many. As a student engaged in online learning, I would like you to reflect on your current situation as a learner. Write about the challenges you encounter every day, the funny moments you experienced, and personal suggestions as to how the learning process can be improved. You may also take a picture of your study room or take a screenshot of fun moments with your classmates etc.</i> </p> </div> <br>

These past 3 years have been an experience. Ever since the global pandemic was announced, I feared that I would stop seeing my loved ones and friends but thanks to the internet I was able to talk to old friends and even meet new friends. I thought it would be more difficult to learn during online class, and yes it is difficult but not as difficult as I thought it would be. I had many fun times during online class such as interacting with the teachers or with my fellow students. As much as I hate the fact that the pandemic exists, I would still not want to forget the experiences of online classes.</i> </p> </div> <br>
